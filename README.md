# NLP-Text-Classification-Spam-vs-Non-Spam-
The aim of this project is to build an intelligent system that classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and traditional Machine Learning models. The focus is on end-to-end implementation: from preprocessing text data to evaluating model performance using real-world metrics

🔍 What We Did:

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and ensured data quality.

Text Preprocessing: Tokenized messages, removed stopwords, and applied lemmatization to normalize text.

Feature Engineering: Transformed textual data into numerical form using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Trained two machine learning models:

> Multinomial Naive Bayes

> Logistic Regression

Model Evaluation: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Achieved ~97% accuracy with Naive Bayes and ~95% with Logistic Regression.

🌍 Real-World Applications:

> Spam detection in email services.

> Filtering promotional or phishing SMS.

> Preprocessing for chatbot and customer service systems.



✅ Why This Project is Valuable:

> Uses practical, real-world data.

> Showcases classic NLP and ML workflows.

> Simple and effective—great for beginners and educational demos.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used:

> Python

> Pandas for data manipulation

> NLTK for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

> Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

> TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction

> Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression as classification algorithms
